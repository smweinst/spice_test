# GitHub page for the Simple Permutation-based Intermodal CorrEspondence (SPICE) test

## What's included:

### (1) maptest_script.R
- includes the basic script for implementing a test of intermodal correspondence
- function can be implemented either as map.test() or spice.test()
- Input arguments:
    K: number of permutations (in the paper, we use 999)
    X.mat: each row is made up of locations in the "X" modality for each subject (number of rows of X.mat should equal the number of subjects; number of columns of X.mat should equal the number of locations in each image)
    Y.mat: same as X.mat but for the "Y" modality. Dimension of this matrix should be the same as for X.mat
    use_cores: defaults to 1 (specify the number of cores to use for parallelizing parts of the code
    
### (2) bird_script_batch.R
- Code for conducting simulations from paper. See description and results of these simulations in sections 2.3, 3.1, and in Figure 4.
